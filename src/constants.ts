ThalaLink ‚Äì A Smart Ecosystem for Blood & Care Management
AI for Good Hackathon Submission

1. üéØ Target Problem Statement
Thalassemia patients in India face challenges accessing regular blood donors, managing care schedules, and receiving consistent support. There‚Äôs also a lack of integration between blood donation systems and patient care resources. ThalaLink aims to solve these gaps using an AI-powered, human-centric platform that streamlines donor-patient matching and supports continuous care coordination.

2. üí° Proposed Solution
ThalaLink is an AI-powered platform designed to support Thalassemia patients by connecting them with blood donors, healthcare providers, and emotional care tools. It predicts donor availability, facilitates smart matching, and provides educational and emotional support through an AI chatbot. It also gamifies the donor experience to encourage recurring participation.

Key Features:
- Predictive Donor Availability: Forecasts donation windows using AI models.
- Smart Matching Engine: Real-time pairing of patients and donors based on urgency, location, and history.
- Care Companion Chatbot: Offers medication reminders, emotional check-ins, and local health tips.
- Gamified Donor Engagement: Rewards, badges, and recognition to retain donors.
- Human-Centric Design: Multilingual, accessible UI with educational content and emotional support tools.

3. üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Frontend: React (Web), Flutter (Mobile)
- Backend: Node.js / Django / Firebase Functions
- AI & ML: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Dialogflow)
- Database: PostgreSQL / Firestore
- APIs: e-RaktKosh, Blood Bridge, Google Maps, Twilio (SMS/voice)
- Security: OAuth2, AES Encryption, Firebase Auth, GCP Secrets Manager

4. üì± Functionality & User Interaction
- Donors: Mobile app with history, reminders, and gamified rewards.
- Patients: Dashboard + chatbot for tracking transfusions, care education, and emotional wellness.
- Healthcare Providers: Admin portal to monitor patient needs and coordinate logistics.

Future Scope:
